# SHREC 2021 track: Retrieval and classification of protein surfaces equipped with physical and chemical properties


A dataset of approximately 5,000 protein surfaces and corresponding physicochemical properties is provided. Each model is represented by an OFF file and a TXT file. Each row of the TXT file corresponds to a vertex of the triangulation in the corresponding OFF file (in the same order); each row in the TXT file contains the three physicochemical properties evaluated at the corresponding vertex in the OFF file. The dataset is already split into a training set (`dataset/training_set`) and a test set (`dataset/test_set`),  in the proportion 70%-30%.
