GROUND TRUTHS

(1) PDB-BASED CLASSIFICATION
*) ClassTraining.cla is the PDB-based classification for the training set.
*) ClassTest.cla is the PDB-based classification for the test set.
ClassTest.cla is used to generate: 
*) Tables 3, 5 
*) Figures 11, A.13, A.14

(2) 4-LEVEL BLAST-BASED CLASSIFICATION
macro_classes.txt joins clusters of protein surfaces starting from the clusters given in ClassTest.cla. It is used to generate:
*) Tables 4, 6
*) Figures 12, B.15, B.16

(3) 3-LEVEL BLAST-BASED CLASSIFICATION
macro_classes_95.txt further joins clusters of protein surfaces and is used to generate: 
*) Tables C.7, C.8
*) Figures C.17 C.18, C.19
